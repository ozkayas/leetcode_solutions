'''Given the computational power of all the n servers as an array of integers powers, find the maximum number of servers that the client can buy such that the selected set of servers can be rearranged in a way that the absolute difference between the computational power of two adjacent servers is less than or equal to 1. The client wants to create a circular network so the first and last servers in the sequence are also considered adjacent.

More formally, a sequence candidate[] of length m is classified as a candidate for selection by the client if it can be rearranged in a way such that abs(candidate[i] - candidate[i+1]) <= 1 for 0 <= i < m - 1 and abs (candidate[m-1] - candidate[0]) <= 1. (Yus, I double checked it is called "candidate".. no typo here :)

Find the maximum number of servers the client can buy from the n avalable servers.
