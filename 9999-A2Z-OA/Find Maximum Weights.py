'''Given an array weight which denotes the weights of n packages, the goal is to create the lexicographically maximal resulting array sorted by non-increasing order of weight using the following operations:


Discard the first package from the current weight array

Add the first element to the resulting array, then remove it along with the next k (a fixed constant) elements from the current array

Note that Operation 2 can also be applied when fewer than k elements remain after the current element; in that case, the entire remaining array is removed.

The resulting array must have packages arranged in non-increasing weight order.

Given an array weight of size n and an integer k, find the lexicographically maximal resulting array sorted by non-increasing order of weight that can be obtained.

Note: An array x is lexicographically greater than an array y if:

x[i] > y[i], where i is the first position where x and y differ, or

|x| > |y| and y is a prefix of x (where |x| denotes the size of array x)

Example:
k = 1
n = 5
weight = [4, 3, 5, 5, 3]

To obtain the lexicographically maximal resulting array sorted in non-increasing order, we will perform the following operations:

ðŸ“„ GÃ¶rsel 2 â€“ AdÄ±m AdÄ±m Ä°ÅŸlem Tablosu
Current Array	Operation Applied	Modified Current Array	Resulting Array
[4, 3, 5, 5, 3]	1) Discard the first element	[3, 5, 5, 3]	[]
[3, 5, 5, 3]	1) Discard the first element	[5, 5, 3]	[]
[5, 5, 3]	2) Discard first k+1 and add first discarded element in resulting array	[3]	[5]
[3]	2) Discard first k+1 and add first discarded element in resulting array	[]	[5, 3]

After performing the above operations, the resulting array is [5, 3]. It is guaranteed that no other resulting array sorted in non-increasing order can be formed that is lexicographically larger than [5, 3].

Therefore, the final array is [5, 3].
