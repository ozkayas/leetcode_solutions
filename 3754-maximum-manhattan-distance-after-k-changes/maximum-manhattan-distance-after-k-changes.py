From the analysis in Approach 1, we can observe that the optimal strategy is to modify the less frequent letters in both directions whenever possible.

Therefore, if we treat the less frequent letters in both the vertical and horizontal directions as a single group, we can reason as follows:

If the total number of such letters is greater than k, then modifying any k of them increases the Manhattan distance by 2Ã—k.
If the total number is less than or equal to k, then all the less frequent letters in both directions will be modified, and no further modifications are necessary. In this case, the Manhattan distance becomes equal to the length of the string.
